      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        In 1988, the crime rate in the United States rises four hundred percent.
        The once-great city of New York becomes the one maximum-security prison
        for the entire country.
      </p>
      <p>
        A fifty-foot containment wall is erected along the New Jersey shoreline,
        across the Harlem river, and down along the Brooklyn shoreline. It
        completely surrounds Manhattan Island.
      </p>
      <p>All bridges and waterways are mined.</p>
      <p>

        The United States Police Force, like an army, is encamped around the
        island.There are no guards inside the prison: only prisoners and the
        worlds they have made.
      </p>
      <p>The rules are simple. Once you go in, you don't come out.</p>
